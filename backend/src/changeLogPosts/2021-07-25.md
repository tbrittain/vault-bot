## Version 0.2
### Feature additions:
- Song export to your own Spotify library!
- Artist biographies (where available) present at the bottom of artist pages (note: this is still an experimental feature and is not perfect)
- Improved homepage, displaying a randomly selected featured artist each day and recent genre trends
- Spotify integrations on artist and song pages, allowing quick access to opening the respective artist/page on Spotify
- EveryNoise integration on genre pages, allowing quick access to viewing the genre in detail
- Added a play button over album art on song pages to indicate a preview is available, and switched the interaction to play it on click, rather than on hover (increases accessibility on mobile devices)
- These changelogs!

### Technical fixes/bugfixes:
- Added lazy loading of artist images on genre pages, which significantly reduces the number of requests made to the Spotify servers
- Fixed an issue where the search logo on the Song List clips through the text
- Various CSS fixes to improve appearance and consistency

### What to look out for in v0.3:
- Dark mode
- Song and artist rankings, and improved genre rankings
- Detailed historical data display
