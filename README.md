## The Future
As of 3/12/23, this repo will be archived and no longer maintained. The spiritual successor to the project will be located at [VaultbotX/vaultbot-lite](https://github.com/VaultbotX/vaultbot-lite) (for self-hosting with no associated cloud infrastructure), while a larger-scale version of the project will be in additional repos in the same organization (TBD).

VaultBot is an ongoing project created for two reasons:
1. To catalog and analyze musical tastes over time, and
2. To provide a dynamic, evolving playlist that users add to that periodically purges old songs.
